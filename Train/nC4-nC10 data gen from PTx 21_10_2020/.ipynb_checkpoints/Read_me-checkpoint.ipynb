    "ANN model has MAE in order of 1E-4, which was tested in SA. Convergence of the stationarity equation residual was the same rate as EOS, but dropped sharply after 1E-7. See report of 2020-09-03 and 2020-09-05. This corresponds approximately to the maximum precision of float32. Therefore, consider to specify float64 training if required. How much extra time does this cost?  \n",
