ANN predictions currently slower than EOS.
Suspect Tensorflow to be slow

Do profiling on Stability_and_flash.py, specifically the ln_phi_model_calc(self, a_mix, b_mix, b_i, sum_xjAij), which does:
1) Transform data
2) Predict based on data
3) Reverse transform response

Questions to answer:
1) How much time does ln_phi_calc take in a single SS iteration? (Relative time percent)
    5300 times slower than EOS. See weekly report 2020-10-08
2) Review how much time EOS ln_phi_calc takes, including Z root finding.
3) Time forward transform, model.predict, inverse transform


How to do it:
1) Add @profile before the single it function
2) In SA, enable for loop with self.SA_SS_single_it called n number of times.
3) Disable the rest of SA and phase split to save time.
4) Should display kernprof -l -v stability_and_flash.py

Testing Konverted models
====
27 Dec 2020:
Add ANN import method for use with Numba_no_class_Monahans.
Requires
1) Variable model architecture per component
2) Global namespace for the weights, biases and data transformation constants

How to do it
Use a global np.array for weights, biases and data transformation constants
Make predictions for variable numbe of ANN components/models
Append to the global weights, bias and transformation constants variables. Remember the shapes for prediction.
Transformation constants require tensorflow import
