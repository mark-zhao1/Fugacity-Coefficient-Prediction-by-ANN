Test ANN model for lnphi of nC4 and nC10

Plot residual Gibbs energy of mixing using ANN and EOS, for a mixing line partially in 2-phase region.

Use training data generated from data_gen_from_PTx.py located in Train/nC4-nC10 data gen from PTx larger/data_gen_from_PTx.py

The training data spanned in P-T-x:

    P_min = 5 # [bar]
    P_max = 100
    num_P = 320

    T_min = 300
    T_max = 650
    num_T = 1000

    x_nC4_min = 0
    x_nC4_max = 1
    num_x_nC4 = 100

MAE was 0.001 for nC4, 0.002 for nC10.

G_R plotted using code copied from nC4-nC10_Residual_Gibbs_applied.py located at Applied_model/nC4-nC10_Residual_Gibbs_applied.py
